## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Parcel

### What I learned

- Shadows are difficult to recreate if there is no design.
- My solution for background graphics may not be optimal. Especially the responsive behavior. However, I haven't come up with something better yet.
- I recreated the designs in Figma and took them as a template for development. Nevertheless, it differs from the default designs (if you superimpose solution and design) üßêü§∑
- This time I didn't use "Fluid Spacings & Typography".

### Continued development

So far I have not tested my solution in other browsers except Firefox.
